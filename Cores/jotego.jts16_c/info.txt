This is a custom core combining Jotego's SEGA System 16A and 16B cores. All original core development is by JT - if you enjoy these games, I highly recommend you support his Patreon to support the ongoing work he and his team do. I'm not associated with Jotego, aside from being a Patreon supporter. 

Please do not report issues with this complete core to Jotego! If there's an issue, please test the issue with the original cores first.

Thanks to Dyreschlock for the great platform art! Check out his Github page - he's made lots of great custom art you can use for other cores too.
