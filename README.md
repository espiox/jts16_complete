# openFPGA/Analogue Pocket Multi-Cores

By making some small edits to JSON files it's possible to combine cores created for openFPGA/Analogue Pocket, grouping arcade games together and reducing the number of platforms in your menus. Here I'm providing ready-made core combinations as a convenience for other Pocket users. For instructions on how to do this yourself, [I wrote a short tutorial](https://github.com/espiox/openfpga-combo-cores/blob/main/Combining-Cores.md).

Important notes:
- **Please support original core developers where possible,** they do great work making these cores, all I did is shuffle some files around a bit.
- **Please do not report issues with these multi-cores to original core devs.** If there's an issue with the multi-core, please test the issue with the original core and [create an issue here](https://github.com/espiox/openfpga-combo-cores/issues) if it's specific to the multi-core.
- **No ROM files are included.**

## Beta Cores
The following core is in patron-only beta, and therefore only the folders and JSON files are included here. **You must be a Jotego patron and provide your own .rbf_r files to use this until it is publicly available.** Simply get the jts16.rbf_r and jts16b.rbf_r files from the beta zips and place them in Cores/jotego.jts16_c.
