# SEGA System 16 Complete Core for Analogue Pocket/openFPGA

![jts16_c](https://github.com/espiox/jts16_complete/assets/60354147/4cf52a10-8624-4249-a715-933d83e74337)

This is a custom core combining [Jotego](https://www.patreon.com/jotego)'s SEGA System 16A and 16B cores, allowing all S16 games to be played from one entry in your Pocket menu without having to remember which games work on which hardware. All original core development is by JT - if you enjoy these games, I highly recommend you support his Patreon to support the ongoing work he and his team do.

## Important Info
- No ROM files are included.
- I'm not associated with Jotego, aside from being a Patreon supporter.
- **Please do not report issues with this complete core to Jotego.** If there's an issue, please test the issue with the original cores first. If it's specific to the complete core, [create an issue here](https://github.com/espiox/openfpga-combo-cores/issues).
- Thanks to [Dyreschlock](https://github.com/dyreschlock) for the great custom platform art featured above! Check out his [Github repo](https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images) for platform art and metadata for other Pocket cores!


## How to Combine Cores
By making some edits to .json files it's possible to combine cores created for openFPGA/Analogue Pocket, grouping arcade games together and reducing the number of platforms in your menus. For instructions on how to do this yourself, [I wrote a short tutorial](https://espiox.net/combining-cores/).
